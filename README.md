# This project is a Twitter/X clone created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
**It replicates the modern layout and design of the X (Twitter) interface with:**

- 🖥️ Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

- 🧭 Sidebar navigation and trending section

- 💬 Post creation section with media icons

- 🎥 Embedded video post support

- 🌙 Clean dark theme design

**Built as part of my Frontend Development practice, this project helped me strengthen my skills in Tailwind CSS layout design, responsive UI, and component structuring.**
